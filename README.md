## Introduction
In this game, we mainly apply three main techniques to this project. First, we use ARImageAnchor. It can recognize the image once you designate an image as an anchor. Second is Firebase Storage and Database. We upload the image to the storage and get the url of the image and then store the relative information such as hints and the url of the image to the database. Third, exporting the 3D model from Unity by some tools like FBX convertor UI. And the process of the game is as follows:
